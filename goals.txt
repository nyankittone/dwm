--- patchset goals ---
- keychords patch.
- New layouts: bottomstack, and column.
- pertag patch and combo patch working together.
- alwayscenter patch.
- cursorwarp patch.
- systray support for the bar, alongside optionally sgrstatus patch.
- config option for attaching to either the top or bottom of the stack.
- Experiment with fullscreen patches. I want something that works nicer for games.
